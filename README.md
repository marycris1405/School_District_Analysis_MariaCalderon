## Challenge

It's discovered that the score averages for ninth grades form one high school are incorrect. The information needs to remove the math and reading scores for that high-school, but without removing those ninth-grade students from the analysis.

The best approach for it is the following:
* Remove all the math and reading scores of the ninth graders at Thomas High School.
* Remove the ninth-grade math and reading scores from Thomas High School.
* Keep all other data associated with the ninth-grade students and Thomas High School intact. 

### Observations
1. How is the district summary affected?
2. How is the school summary affected?
3. How does removing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance, relative to other schools?
4. How does removing the ninth-grade score affect the Math and Reading Scores by Grade, Scores by School Spenging, Scores by School Size, and Score by School Type?
